# Recursion-Method-Application
This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the merge sort algorithm, a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. The code recursively divides an input array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them individually, and then merges them back together to produce a sorted result. It also contains a JavaScript function for generating Fibonacci sequences. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

# Merge Sort Algorithm Explanation
- Divide the input array into two halves.
- Recursively apply the merge sort algorithm to each half.
- Merge the sorted halves back together, maintaining the order.

# Fibonacci Generator Algorithm Explanation
The Fibonacci sequence generator uses a simple iterative algorithm to generate the sequence. It starts with two initial values (0 and 1) and then calculates subsequent values by adding the previous two numbers.
